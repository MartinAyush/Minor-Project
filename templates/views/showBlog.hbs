                range of workspace accessories has improved my home office</h1>
            <p class="lead text-right">by Ste Knight | November 2, 2020</p>
            <p class="text-monospace" style="font-size: 18px;">As a freelance writer, lockdown has probably had less of
                an effect on my life than it has for other people. I’m familiar with sitting in my home office
                mercilessly thrashing away at my poor GPGR mechanical keyboard. That doesn’t mean my office was
                perfectly functional, though. There was a lot of inconvenience about the space I was using.

                However, several of the office accessories that Fluidstance has within its range have really helped me
                organize my office area into something a little more user-friendly. If your desk is a pile of paper,
                pens, and post-it notes, you need to get into the Fluidstance way of thinking.

                Here, I’m going to review a couple of my favorite items from the range. Let’s go!

            <h1 class="text-center text-capitalize" style="text-decoration: underline;">Sony has no plans for
                PlayStation VR, at least for the foreseeable future</h1>
            <p class="lead text-right">by Kevin Raposo | November 2, 2020</p>
            <p class="text-monospace" style="font-size: 18px;">If you have a PlayStation 4, you are almost certainly
                aware of the PSVR, Sony’s foray into the world of virtual reality. While VR absolutely has a positive
                future, at present, it is still seen as more of a gimmicky way to play games than anything else.

                In fact, only about five million PlayStation 4 owners own one of the VR headsets. That’s a middling 4%
                of the console’s total user base of approximately 113 million gamers. Now, from an interview with The
                Washington Post, Jim Ryan, president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, notes that “we’re more
                than a few minutes from the future of VR.”

                Basically, what this means is that, at present, VR and Sony’s headset, is not at the forefront of what
                gamers should expect from their PlayStation 5 experiences, at least not right away.

                All hope is not lost, however, as current PSVR owners will still be able to play and enjoy the
                PlayStation games they own on the console. So, that’s nice.

                Honestly, this isn’t that surprising. As we alluded to at the beginning of the article, VR just isn’t
                quite there yet. While it can be fun, as games like Beat Saber and Half-Life: Alyx has shown, it’s still
                not the polished, full-bodied experience that console players are really searching for…yet.

            <h1 class="text-center text-capitalize" style="text-decoration: underline;">Apple TV is finally making its
                way to all Xbox consoles on November 10</h1>
            <p class="lead text-right">by Josiah Motley | November 2, 2020</p>
            <p class="text-monospace" style="font-size: 18px;">Microsoft is opening up the doors to the Apple TV app.
                Starting November 10, Apple’s streaming app will be available on all Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Xbox
                Series S consoles, giving Xbox users access to all of the company’s original programming and movie
                library.

                On top of that, Microsoft wants folks to know that it’s making a bunch of other widely-popular streaming
                apps available on launch day for the Xbox Series S and X.

                These apps include Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, Spotify, YouTube, YouTube TV, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu,
                NBC Peacock, Vudu, FandangoNow, Twitch, Sky Go, NOW TV, Sky Ticket, and more. Apps like Netflix,
                Disney+, and Vudu will support Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos for both the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series
                S.

                Apple launched its Apple TV app a year ago, and yes, that’s quite some time for Microsoft to make the
                app available to Xbox users, but hey, it’s better than nothing. Meanwhile, the app will also arrive on
                the PS5 when it launches on November 12.
